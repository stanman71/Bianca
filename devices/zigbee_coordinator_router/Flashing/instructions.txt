- Install SmartRF Flash programmer
- Install the CC debugger driver

  >>> When I used the setup the installation was not correct, and manually pointing to the drivers was needed

- Connect both USB (from debugger and Sniffer) the same time
- If the light on the CC debugger is RED, press set reset button on the CC debugger
  The light on the CC debugger should now turn GREEN

- Start SmartRF Flash Programmer, setup as shown below and click “Perform actions”
